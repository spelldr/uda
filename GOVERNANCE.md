# Governance

## Who Maintains This?

You designate maintainers. Everyone else contributes.

## Approval Rules

- **Content updates** → 1 maintainer approval
- **Template/routing changes** → 2 maintainers
- **Governance changes** → All maintainers agree

## How to Contribute

1. Open an issue describing what you want to add/change
2. Follow the templates in `starter-kit/templates/`
3. Add required metadata (see `starter-kit/governance/metadata-schema.yaml`)
4. Submit a PR
5. Wait for approval

That's it. No committees, no lengthy reviews. Just clarity on who decides what.

## Release Cycle

- **Patches** (fixes): As needed
- **Minor** (new templates): Quarterly
- **Major** (routing changes): Annually or as needed

See CONTRIBUTING.md for contribution details.
- Use the correct content type and template.

## 5. Conflict Resolution

1. Discuss the issue in the relevant GitHub thread.
2. If unresolved, escalate to maintainers.

## 6. Transparency

All governance decisions, structural changes, and release notes are documented publicly in:

- GitHub issues  
- Pull requests  
- Release notes  
- `/CHANGELOG.md` (if present)

## 7. Amendments

Any changes to this governance model require:

- A governance‑type issue.
- A pull request referencing that issue.
- Unanimous maintainer approval.
